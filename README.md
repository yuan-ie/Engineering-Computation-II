# ece_3822: Engineering-Computation-II

This class bases all the lessons and assignments around C++ and Python.
With only prior knowledge and experience with C, I was able to self-teach myself the basics of C++ and Python,
while learning how to create data structures through various methods such as:
  * classes, objects, and constructors
  * classes of classes
  * buffers
  * linked lists (singly and doubly)
  * binary search tree
  * hash tables
  * binary heap
    
Along with various features for data structures such as:
  * search function
  * collision-check function
  * case-sensitivity
