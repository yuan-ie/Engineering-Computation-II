Lab 01
Due Sunday September 3rd before midnight
Submit on ece-000 using the "submit.py" script (see below for instructions)

In this lab you will write one C++ file and one Python file to do the following tasks:
1. Read a list of integers from a text file
2. Print the average value, accurate to two decimal places
3. Print the square root of the product of the largest two values, accurate to two decimal places

You are provided with 'stub' code to get you started. I'm providing you with code for 
the file IO, so you don't have to remember the syntax for that.

Test your code properly. I will be testing your code on one or more secret data 
files, so make sure your number crunching will work no matter whats in my file!
You can assume the contents of the data text file will always be a list of integers.

The goals for this lab are:
1. Make sure you can write simple programs in C++ and Python
2. Make sure you can follow instructions for using the submit.py script
3. Get you thinking about how choice of data structures might make certain tasks easier

Your code should be properly documented with good use of "self-documenting code".

To copy the code to your local folder, type the following at the terminal
from your home directory:
rsync -av $SHARE/lab_01 .

Alternately, you can use point-and-click to copy/paste the files from $SHARE/lab_01
to your home directory

SUBMISSION
When you are done, open a command line, change directories to the lab_01 directory, and type:
./submit.py
This will submit both your Python and C++ files at the same time
