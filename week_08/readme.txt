hash_table_v01.cpp: simple hash table, hashes by first and last names

hash_table_v02.cpp: database that uses two hash tables (last name and
first-and-last name) complete with search functions

hash_table_v03.cpp: same as v02 but instead of storing students in the hash
tables, we are storing pointers to students
