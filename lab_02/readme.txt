Lab 02
Due Sunday September 10th before midnight
Submit on ece-000 using the "submit.py" script

In this week's lab you will practice writing some straightforward
object-oriented code. You should write the code twice: once in Python
and again in C++

Write a class called "student" that stores a student's name and grades
and can return the maximum and the average grade, as well as display a
student summary. The grades will be integers between 0 and 100. The display
should follow the format of:
Name: grade 1, grade 2, ... grade N
If you want, you can pick an arbitrary maximum number of grades. Or you can
make it so there is no set maximum number.

The code should be written as a .cpp or .py library that only contains 
the class (no main function). You can use the provided "lab_02.py" and 
"lab_02.cpp" to test your class files. Do not edit those files! You will need
to make edits to student.h. You will also need to create a Makefile to 
compile the C++ code.

Be sure to make your code robust. I will be testing your code using
test cases that you don't get to see.

What to turn in:
Write "student.cpp" and "student.py"
When you are done, submit using ./submit.py

Good luck! Email me with questions.
